Alembic Migrations
==================

This folder contains the Alembic migrations for the {{package}} project.

This folder is placed in the source folder of the project so that it gets
included in the distribution package for project {{package}}.

This makes it easy to refer to the migration environment path in the
pyramid .ini file.
